## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Java, Springboot, React, and MongoDB.

In this project I created a movie website that includes the ability for the user to watch trailers on youtube and leave a review on the film to send to the database. 

## Optimizations

I added some simple colors to make the application more user friendly. I also made it so that the images of each movie transitions to the next for the user. I also tried to use as much simple and clean code as possible to make sure the application works as smooth as possible.
## Lessons Learned:

For this application I learned how to to use Java and Springboot and how to structure them correctly for my backend.
From my client I learned how to improve my react skills including how to add video processing and connect it to my java application.
I learned how to enhance my skills in the seperation of concerns using 2 different technologies.
